### Important Notes slides:

Remember project focus is on Binary.
Confusing usage of review ticket, a review requires demonstration of tangibles. 
Remember  materials are required to be in ONE PLACE, your GitHub.  Usage of GitHub Issues, GitHub Pages, or GitHub Repo are acceptable locations.  Do not require Teacher to access information using an account.
Graders need to. give productive comments (1 or 2 positives and 1 or 2 growth statements would be a minimum. 
As a positive, there is one terrific example from Hanlun, Lakshanya, Matthew, Aditya, Trevor.  Only issue with there could be solved by adding Utterance comment to page.
